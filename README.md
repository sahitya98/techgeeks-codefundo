As we know the voting process in India is the most important as well as most prone to frauds. Voting is the right of every citizen but the voting process in various places is mostly manual and involves a lot of chaos. And for people in remote places like army people it is difficult to cast their vote. Blockchain provides a way of safe mode of recording data and resists any kind of modification. Hence we can bring up online voting system using blockchain by providing 100% surity of recording data permanantly and cannot be altered by any external party. The idea is to create a unique login for each citizen capable of voting. Once they open the portal and cast their vote it will be recorded in a blockchain system which will be handled by several authorities. Once an individual cast their vote their ID will be deactivated automatically to avoid multiple entries. This is just a basic idea. We want to develop it by including multiple layers of security in the blockchain system.
